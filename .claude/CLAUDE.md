## Important Implementation Details

### Waveform Data
- Pre-computed on upload and stored in `tracks.waveform_data` as JSONB
- Displayed using WaveSurfer.js in player and track rows

### Analytics Deduplication
- Page views deduplicated by IP + share link (10-minute window)
- Play events deduplicated by IP + track + share (5-minute window)

### Section Management
- Sections have position for ordering
- Unsectioned tracks show at top in "Tracks" pseudo-section
- Can convert unsectioned tracks to a real section

### Storage Paths
- Audio: `audio/{user_id}/{filename}`
- Playlist artwork: `playlist-artwork/{playlist_id}.{ext}`
